``Mac OS`` is a colloquial term used to describe a series of operating systems developed for the ``Macintosh`` family
of personal computers by ``Apple Inc``. The Macintosh operating system is credited with having popularized the graphical
user interface concept.

Step 1: install Docker
======================

Make sure ``Docker`` is installed on your ``Mac``. Visit :doc:`/user-guide/troubleshooting` section to find corresponding instructions.

Step 2: choose release version
==============================

Visit ``Remme-core`` `releases list <https://github.com/Remmeauth/remme-core/releases>`_  to choose the right version
based on the changelog of each option.

Then change the value of ``REMME_CORE_RELEASE`` below. Though, we would recommend the latest version of the project that
already specified in the command below.

.. |remme_core_releases_list| raw:: html

   <a href="https://github.com/Remmeauth/remme-core/releases" target="_blank">Remme-core releases list</a>

Step 3: install, build and run the node
=======================================

Open a terminal on your PC. Visit :doc:`/user-guide/troubleshooting` section to find instructions. Then copy the command below and paste to the terminal.

.. code-block:: console

   $ export REMME_CORE_RELEASE=0.6.0-alpha && \
         curl -OL https://github.com/Remmeauth/remme-core/archive/v$REMME_CORE_RELEASE.zip && \
         unzip v$REMME_CORE_RELEASE.zip && \
         rm -rf v$REMME_CORE_RELEASE.zip && \
         cd remme-core-$REMME_CORE_RELEASE && \
         ./scripts/run.sh -g

The expected result of the command is illustrated below.

When you see the same output as illustrated below, it means the node is ready to accept requests.

Step 4: ensure the node is working
==================================

To check if your node did a correct set-up, open a brand new terminal window and send getting node configurations keys request.

.. code-block:: console

   $ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d \
         '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"11","method":"get_node_config","params":{}}' | python -m json.tool

The response should look as illustrated below.

.. code-block:: console

   {
       "id": "11",
       "jsonrpc": "2.0",
       "result": {
           "node_public_key": "028e7e9b060d7c407e428676299ced9afef4ce782995294d8ea01fd0f08cec9765",
           "storage_public_key": "028e7e9b060d7c407e428676299ced9afef4ce782995294d8ea01fd0f08cec9765"
       }
   }

The flow is illustrated below.
